Hi, I'm Josh!  Welcome to my website, where I hope to show off some of my side projects.

By trade I'm a cartographer, but I dabble in ecology and data science.  I make web maps, story maps, and paper maps - all because I enjoy data visualization!  To learn more about my professional work, check out my CV. Otherwise browse the posts pages for topics that might interest you.  Mostly you'll find R projects and web maps, but there's an assortment.

If you're not here to talk shop and just want to see some pretty pictures, check out my instagram instead.  In my spare time, I explore this incredible planet earth - usually by backpacking into mountain wilderness.  There are a lot of posts there of the Sierra Nevada, which I currently call home.
