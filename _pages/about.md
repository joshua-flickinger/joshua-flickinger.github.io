Hi, I'm Josh!  Welcome to my website, where I hope to show off some of my work and record side projects.

By trade I'm a cartographer, working for the National Park Service (#findyourpark).  But I dabble in ecology and data science.  I make web maps, story maps, and paper maps - all because I enjoy data visualization!

In my spare time, I explore this incredible planet earth!  Usually by packpacking into mountain wilderness.  See my instagram.
