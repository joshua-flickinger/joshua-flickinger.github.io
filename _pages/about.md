Hi, I'm Josh!  Welcome to my website, where I hope to show off some of my work and record side projects.

By trade I'm a cartographer, but I dabble in ecology and data science.  I make web maps, story maps, and paper maps - all because I enjoy data visualization!  To learn more about my work, check out my CV and posts pages.

In my spare time, I explore this incredible planet earth!  Usually by backpacking into mountain wilderness.  See my instagram for that.
